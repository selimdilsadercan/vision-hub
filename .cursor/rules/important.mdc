- do not create shadcn compoennts by yourself
- use react-hot-toast we already have in app
- use npx shadcn@latest instead of npx shadcn-ui@latest
- if i say you to use a component for a task always search detaily if is this component exists in components folder
- do not left unnecessary imports, and unused variables
- do not use "any" type
- use next.config.ts instead of next.config.js
- while implementing ui always first check related functions in supabase-types.ts file for types
- look for main pages = (main)/, project pages = project/[id]/, auth pages = (auth)/
- do not use params.id use useParams
